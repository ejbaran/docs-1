title: Overview
Algorand maintains SDK support in [JavaScript](#javascript), [Python](#python), [Java](#java) and [Go](#go). More languages are also available through [Community Provided SDKs](../../community/#sdks). The Algorand SDKs offer both standalone and network-connected development functionality. Browse the full set of supported features and example code in each of the SDKs in the [Features section](../../features/index.md) of the docs. To get started, install your SDK of choice following the installation directions below then visit the [Start Building section](../../build-apps/setup.md) to learn how to send your first transaction.

    All examples on this page assume the data directory is ~/node/data

# REST Endpoints
Integration with the Algorand protocol daemon (`algod`), Algorand key management daemon (`kmd`) or Algorand Indexer daemon (`algorand-indexer`) is provided using a set of [REST APIs](../index.md#rest-apis). These APIs are described using the [Open API Specification version 2 (OAS 2)](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md). The `algod` and `kmd` daemons serve their respective API from the _address:port_ defined within the _algod.net_ and _kmd.net_ files found in the _~/node/data_ and _~/node/data/kmd-{version}_ directories. The `algorand-indexer` daemon provides its API from the _host:port_ defined by the _--server_ flag specified at start up. The `algod` and `kmd` daemons provide their API specifications in a swagger json format available from this endpoint: 

Algorand Protocol Daemon (`algod`)

```zsh
curl http://$(cat ~/node/data/algod.net)/swagger.json
```

Algorand Key Management Daemon (`kmd`)

```zsh
curl http://$(cat ~/node/data/kmd-v0.5/kmd.net)/swagger.json
```

!!! info
    The `kmd` daemon is only automatically started when using the `goal` command line tool with specific commands requiring key management access. Also, this daemon times out after 60 seconds of being idle. If you require API access to `kmd` you will need to manually start the process with `goal` using the command: `goal kmd start -d <data-dir>`.

!!! info
    All REST methods and models are fully described within [reference documentation](../index.md#rest-apis). 

# Security Token
Most REST calls will also require an API token header to authenticate with the API server. For both `algod` and `kmd` the token is automatically generated by the daemon at startup and stored in a file. `algod` places _algod.token_ in the _~/node/data_ directory. `kmd` places _kmd.token_ the _~/node/data/kmd-{version}_ directory. Security tokens can be regenerated for both using the `goal node generatetoken` command. The `algorand-indexer` daemon allows configuration of the security token at startup using the _--token_ flag and specifying a value. 

| Daemon             | Header Identifier   | Header Value Defined Via                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `algod`            | X-Algo-API-Token    | file: ~/node/data/algod.token                 |
| `kmd`              | X-KMD-API-Token     | file: ~/node/data/kmd-{version}/kmd.token     |
| `algorand-indexer` | X-Indexer-API-Token | flag: --token {your_value_here}               |

Each SDK provides a method for setting these headers. Most REST tools provide a method for setting additional headers. To set the header with a `curl` command use the `-H` parameter. For example, to make a call to retrieve a specific block, use the following curl command:

```zsh
curl http://$(cat ~/node/data/algod.net)/v1/block/31538 -H "X-Algo-API-Token: $(cat ~/node/data/algod.token)"
```

In the above example, the block information will be displayed if the block exists on the local node. If the node is a non-Archival node, older blocks will not be available.

# JavaScript
## Installation
The JavaScript SDK is available as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/algosdk) or as a [minified JavaScript library](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk/blob/master/dist/algosdk.min.js). 

Requirements: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 

```zsh
$ npm install algosdk
```

To install the minified library, download the [latest distribution](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk/tree/develop/dist) and add it to the project's library location. Use the src tag to specify the location of the library.

```javascript tab="JavaScript"
<script src="algosdk.min.js"/> 
```
